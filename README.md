### Three guesses what these are for
 1. You can get the sticker .PNGs (either individually or get [all of them zipped](https://github.com/Johnoss/limmy-stickerpack-resources/blob/master/all-stickers-pngs.zip))
 2. You can get the sticker .PSDs
 3. You can use the .PSDs to create your own stickers

### Creating your own stickers
If you want to create your stickers to be added to the sticker pack, here are some suggestions

- Make a cutout of whatever scene or character you want to use as a sticker
 - Use any of the PSDs as a template and copy the layer style (it's just a white outer stroke)
 - Export as .PNG
 - Send the PNG to me directly or make a pull request
 - If you don't want to use the .PSD template (e.g. you don't have photoshop), just know that the format must be 512x512px with transparent background

I reserve a right to be a dick and decline to add stickers to the pack, but I'll try to be as inclusive as possible
